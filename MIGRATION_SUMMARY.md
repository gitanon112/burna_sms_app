# Burna SMS Migration Summary

## Overview
We have successfully migrated the Burna SMS backend functionality from Python to Flutter, eliminating the need for the old Python backend at `localhost:8000`.

## What Has Been Migrated

### 1. Direct DaisySMS Integration
- Created `lib/services/daisy_sms_client.dart` - Direct API client for DaisySMS
- No longer requires Python proxy for DaisySMS API calls

### 2. Business Logic
- Created `lib/services/burna_service.dart` - Contains all business logic:
  - 2x markup pricing
  - Rental management
  - User profile updates
  - Direct Supabase integration

### 3. Service Layer Updates
- Updated `lib/services/daisy_proxy_service.dart` to use BurnaService
- Removed all localhost:8000 API calls
- Now uses direct DaisySMS integration

## OAuth Configuration Issue

The current error when clicking "Sign in with Google" is because:
1. The old Python backend handled OAuth callbacks at `localhost:8000`
2. We've eliminated the Python backend
3. OAuth needs to be configured for mobile deep linking

### Required Manual Steps

1. **Update Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Add `com.burnasms.app://auth-callback` to the list of allowed redirect URLs
   - Ensure Google OAuth provider is enabled

2. **iOS Configuration** (Already Done):
   - Info.plist already has URL scheme: `com.burnasms.app`
   - This matches the redirect URL in app_constants.dart

## What Can Be Removed

The entire `/burna-sms` Python backend can now be removed:
- No longer needed for authentication (handled by Supabase directly)
- No longer needed for DaisySMS API calls (handled by Flutter)
- No longer needed for business logic (migrated to Flutter)
- No longer needed for database operations (handled by Supabase SDK)

## Testing the Migration

Once the Supabase redirect URL is configured:
1. Run the Flutter app: `flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro"`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Test purchasing a number
5. Test checking SMS
6. Test canceling a rental

## Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `lib/services/daisy_sms_client.dart` - Direct DaisySMS API client
- `lib/services/burna_service.dart` - Core business logic service

### Modified Files:
- `lib/services/daisy_proxy_service.dart` - Now uses BurnaService instead of localhost
- `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` - Added OAuth configuration
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added uuid package dependency

## Environment Variables

The DaisySMS API key is currently hardcoded in `burna_service.dart`. 
For production, this should be:
1. Stored in Supabase Edge Functions as an environment variable
2. Or stored securely in the app using flutter_secure_storage
3. Never committed to version control

## Summary

**You no longer need to run the Python backend!** The Flutter app now handles everything directly:
- ✅ Authentication via Supabase OAuth
- ✅ DaisySMS API integration
- ✅ Business logic (2x markup)
- ✅ Database operations via Supabase

The only remaining step is to configure the OAuth redirect URL in your Supabase dashboard.
